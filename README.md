# Example Based Explanation in Machine Learning

A project aiming to implement several approaches to example based explanation, for use with a TensorFlow 2 model.

## Currently Implemented

- Influence Functions[^Influence Functions]
- RelatIF[^ RelatIF]
- Representer Points[^ Representer Points]

## Future Work

- Data Shapley[^ Data Shapley]
- Documentation
- Fisher Kernels[^ Fisher Kernels]

## Examples

The `scripts` folder contain examples of some standard models and datasets, on which the different approaches have been applied. Some of these results are then visualised and compared in the `notebooks` folder in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
